      <p>Ashley O’Connor
        <br>Student ID (RMIT): S3915744
        <br>S3915744@student.rmit.edu.au
        <br>Date of Birth: 16/11/1994
        <br><br>I was born in Upper Ferntree Gully, Victoria and grew up in Mooroolbark, Victoria until I was the age of 12. I currently live in Paynesville, Victoria with the ambition to maybe move somewhere further north for the warmer climate one day. I left school at the end of semester one year 11 in 2012 to pursue a career in Trade sales at a company called Reece Plumbing. After being there for almost 10 years and only being able to obtain a Certificate III in Supply Chain Operations, I recently decided that it was time for a change to improve my mental health and find a career that I enjoy and can hopefully work from home doing. I am now wanting to pursue a career in a field where I find myself most interested in as I adore the use of technology in my day-to-day life.
        <br><br>I am an avid gamer and love long gaming sessions with friends, mainly PC gaming but sometimes even console. I love snowboarding in the Winter & water sports in Summer. I won a senior football grand final in 2013 at the age of 18 and have recently retired after breaking my jaw and hand in two separate seasons. I have a loving and wonderful partner Gemma, whom I have been with for the past 7 years. I also have two dogs named Romeo (Golden Retriever) & Elvis (Beagle x).

      <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
      <h4>• What is my interest in IT? When did my interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked my interest?</h4>
      <p>My interest in IT started when I was 14 years old and was able to purchase my first computer. My uncle is an Electrician and has always connected all different tech products around his house which got me intrigued by how the technology worked. Gaming has also been a massive part of why I am interested in IT as it is from my early childhood days to where I am now. I do not have too much of a background in IT as a job, but some things that I have achieved while learning in my time at home are - Data recovery of HDD's using software, I have now built two of my own custom PC's, installed windows from scratch, overclocked CPU's & GPU's, to helping other employees with basic windows shortcuts & problems.
      </p><br>
      <h4>• Why did I choose to come to RMIT?</h4>
      <p>I chose RMIT as it offered a pathways course with Open Universities Australia. As I did not finish year 12 or have a qualification other than a certificate III, this pathway allows me to complete two units if successful in passing, I can continue with the Bachelor of Information Technology.
      </p><br>
        <h4>• What do I expect to learn during my studies?</h4>
        <p>I hope to have a better understanding of IT at the end of these studies, to be able to excel and develop my experience with IT and turn it into a job which in turn will hopefully turn into a lifestyle. I also am excited to see how these studies can help me improve my ability to communicate more professionally and logically.

        <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
        <h4>• What do the results of these tests mean for me?</h4>
        <p>I need to understand that even though these tests have outlined certain aspects of myself as a person there is still room for improvement in the different areas of learning, personality and creativity. These results should only be a basic guideline to excelling my attributes and working on bettering them.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>• How do I think these results may influence my behaviour in a team?</h4>
        <p>Personality – I take the work I do with great dedication and pride. I can help the team accomplish what tasks lie ahead as a leader.  I need to take caution in my approach to working as a team and not get emotionally strained by what isn’t going right and to let team members know if I have made a mistake.
        <br><br>Learning style – I could find it difficult being a visual learner as I have trouble listening for long periods. I find that I may appear rude when looking for visual clues while others are talking. I usually need to see and read instructions rather than hearing them. Although I could benefit the team by being organised and being good at making things look good.
        <br><br>Creativity – I may lack boldness which may mean that I won’t speak up. Although I can carry large quantities of information and can help in areas where others may lack.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>• How should I take this into account when forming a team?</h4>
        <p>Personality – When forming a team I need to take into account that not everyone may have the same dedication as I do and to help provide my skills as a logistician. I need to let other people have their say on what ideas they bring to the table to make sure everybody is involved and feel comfortable.
        <br><br>Learning style – I may find that other team members learn differently from me and need to let others know what my learning style is so that we can help support each other and to ensure that I have the tools to help support the learning style to best fit my team.
        <br><br>Creativity – I need to understand the low parameters around the lower than average creativity score and to work to my strengths, complexity and connection.
