        <h2>My Project Idea - CrypCo</h2>
      <h4>Overview -</h4>
      <p>CrypCo – Crypco is a website that involves putting all cryptocurrencies and virtual tokens in one place, allowing easy access across the world. This takes out the unnecessary actions of opening multiple wallets to trade across multiple currencies to obtain the one currency that is desired. Cryptocurrency and virtual token trading has started to take off in the past couple of years since BitCoin has started jumping to such high values since the creation of Crypto in 2009.
         I believe that the creation of this website will help ignite the spark even further.
      </p><br>
      <h4>Motivation -</h4>
      <p>There are multiple cryptocurrency and virtual token websites that are already in the marketplace today, but there isn’t one website that lists every single cryptocurrency for trade. Binance has grown to become the most popular cryptocurrency exchange in the world offering over more than 500 unique cryptocurrencies and tokens. Binance created its own virtual token that has increased in popularity over the little time it has been out.
      <br>The Crypto world is in such high demand in current times, I believe that creating a website that contains all created crypto and virtual currency to be accessed and traded in one place will be one of the most used websites in the world.
    </p><br>
      <h4>Description -</h4>
      <p>CrypCo is an online exchange where customers and clients can trade cryptocurrencies and virtual tokens across one website. CrypCo will support more than 4000 cryptocurrencies and virtual tokens and update regularly to include the most up to date and newest currencies. CrypCo will provide a wallet for its customers and clients to be able to hold all currencies if wanted.
         CrypCo will also be providing an investors service to customers that aim to try and help traders to make the right   decisions with their investments. There will be a no-fee for deposits but there will be a fee on buying and selling, these fees will scale on the quantity that has been traded, the lower the quantity the lower the fee. Fees for selling range from .1% to .04% and fees from buying will range from .1% to .02%.  CrypCo will give the option of multiple different deposit options these are but not restricted to Poli, PayPal, Bank transfer, Visa and Mastercard. The service will include a wide range of accepted FIAT currencies, making it easier for the customers and clients to start purchasing crypto. These currencies include AU Dollars, US Dollars, Euros, Pound Sterling and other FIAT currencies. You will also be able to use a wide range of commodity-backed stable coins such as Coinbase UDC Coin (UDSC), Tether (USDT), PAXOS (PAX) and True USD to buy crypto. CrypCo will be implementing a maximum deposit for users until they have verified their account and made multiple transactions throughout the exchange website, the amounts will be up to 2 BTC a day for unverified users and up to 100BTC a day for verified users. CrypCo will be implementing the need for Multi-factor authentication to make sure that clients and customers accounts are as secure as they can be. Eventually, after the website has been established and made its impact on the crypto world the company will be making it a priority to implement an app for mobile platform users making sure that customers and clients can trade on the go from wherever, whenever. There will be bi-monthly reviews on coins that do not have any trading movement to make sure that there is space for future coins or new coins that come out close to review dates. CrypCo will also be reviewing the need to implement a decentralised or centralised finance lending service. In conclusion, I believe with these implementations and certifications that CrypCo will be one of the most visited and used websites across the world.

      <h4>Tools and Technologies -</h4>
      <p>To be able to create this website you will need to use the open-source cryptocurrency exchange software which has many benefits as it can save you a huge amount of development time. There will be multiple software requirements, Java, JavaScript, Python, C, C# and PHP.
         To be able to withstand so much traffic with outgoing and incoming connections from multiple different countries there will be the need for a large server farm so that it can hold vital information and try and keep the website from crashing. The price of this server farm would be well into the millions but is a must for the website to be able to go ahead and be stable
      </p><br>
      <h4>Skills Required -</h4>
      <p>The skills required for this project would range from each employee. You will need back-end developers, cyber-security specialists, front-end developers and also a team of marketing enthusiasts. Creating a website on this level would take a single person over a year whereas with a team of developers it could be accomplished much sooner. A team of developers will be able to code the website and design it in regards to what they all agree on.
         There will need to be a part of your team  that has a very high knowledge of cyber-security as many crypto exchanges are attacked by hackers either trying to steal high-value currency or even credit card information. The marketing team will help push the website to different countries, clients & customers.
      </p><br>
      <h4>Outcome -</h4>
      <p>If this project is successful the outcome would be astronomical, the impact that it will have on the current crypto websites would leave a devastating mark, similar to Facebook taking over MySpace. The original problem of not having all currencies on a single platform will be fixed and the customer base would develop quite quickly. The creators would be able to make an enormous amount of money due to the ads and trading fees.
         I believe the impact would be quite incredibly disruptive to the existing digital currency platforms and would make the crypto market more accessible.
